This is kind of a Spotify clone but I made my own API with springboot to download music from database (https://github.com/AvishkaNilupul/Music_Api).

in addition to that I also added youtube API as well so anyone can easyily search any song inside the download section which is linked to youtube api and download the mp3 version of it as well.
